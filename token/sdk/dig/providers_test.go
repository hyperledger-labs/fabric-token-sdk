// Note: The functions newMultiplexedDriver and newTokenDriverService are dependency injection
// provider functions that use dig.In structs. They are thin wrappers around constructors
// and are primarily tested through integration tests and the SDK wiring test (TestFabricWiring).
// Direct unit testing would require complex mocking of dig.In behavior which provides
// limited value compared to integration testing.
//
// These functions are covered by:
// 1. TestFabricWiring - which tests the full DI container wiring
// 2. Integration tests that exercise the complete SDK initialization
