# Zero Knowledge Asset Transfer DLog Driver

The `Zero Knowledge Asset Transfer DLog` (zkat-dlog, for short) driver supports privacy using Zero Knowledge Proofs. 
We follow a simplified version of the blueprint described in the paper <!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->
[`Privacy-preserving auditable token payments in a permissioned blockchain system`]('https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1058.pdf')<!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->
by Elli Androulaki, Jan Camenisch, Angelo De Caro, Maria Dubovitskaya, Kaoutar Elkhiyaoui, and Bj√∂rn Tackmann.
In more details, the driver hides the token's owner, type, and quantity.
But it reveals which token has been spent by a give transaction. We say that this driver does not support `graph hiding`.
Owner anonymity and unlinkability is achieved by using Identity Mixer (Idemix, for short).
The identities of the issuers and the auditors are not hidden.

The above scheme is secure under `computational assumptions in bilinear groups` in the `random-oracle model`.

The driver implementation is available under the folder [`nogh`](./../../token/core/zkatdlog/nogh).

## Key characteristic

- A token is represented on the ledger as the pair `(pedersen commitment to type and value, owner)`.
- The owner of a token can be:
  - An `Idemix Identity`;
  - An `HTLC-like Script`;
  - A `Multisig Script`.
- An issuer is identified by an X509 certificate. The identity of the issuer is always revealed.
- An auditor is identified by an X509 certificate. The identity of the auditor is always revealed.
- Supported actions are: `Issue` and `Transfer`. `Reedem` is obtained as a `Transfer` that creates an output whose's owner is `none`.
- An `Issue Action` proves ...
- A Transfer Action proves ...
- All the information required to operate the driver are found in the public parameters.
