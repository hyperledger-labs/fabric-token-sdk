# Zero Knowledge Asset Transfer DLog Driver

The `Zero Knowledge Asset Transfer DLog` (zkat-dlog, for short) driver supports privacy using Zero Knowledge Proofs. 
We follow a simplified version of the blueprint described in the paper <!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->
[`Privacy-preserving auditable token payments in a permissioned blockchain system`]('https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1058.pdf')<!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->
by Elli Androulaki, Jan Camenisch, Angelo De Caro, Maria Dubovitskaya, Kaoutar Elkhiyaoui, and Bj√∂rn Tackmann.
In more details, the driver hides the token's owner, type, and quantity.
But it reveals which token has been spent by a given transaction. We say that this driver does not support `graph hiding`.
Owner anonymity is achieved by using Identity Mixer (Idemix, for short).
The identities of the issuers and the auditors are not hidden.

The above scheme is secure under `computational assumptions in bilinear groups` in the `random-oracle model`.

The driver implementation is available under the folder [`nogh/v1`](./../../token/core/zkatdlog/nogh/v1).

## Key characteristics

- A token is represented on the ledger as the pair `(pedersen commitment to type and value, owner)`.
- A token metadata is a tuple containing: Token type, value, commitment blinding factor, and issuer's identity.
- The admissible values are in the range $[0..max-1]$, where $max$ is $2^{bitlength}$ and $bitlength$ is a public parameter. A typical value for $bitlength$ is $64$.
- The owner of a token can be:
  - An `Idemix Identity` to achieve identity anonymity. The public key of the Idemix Identity Issuer can be rotated.
  - An `HTLC-like Script` for interoperability;
  - A `Multisig Identity` for shared ownership;
- An issuer is identified by an X509 certificate. The identity of the issuer is always revealed.
- Multiple issuers can be defined to issue a token type. Each such an issuer can issue tokens of said type; This allows also for rotation of these keys.
- An auditor is identified by an X509 certificate. The identity of the auditor is always revealed.
- Only one auditor is definable and it is public key cannot be rotated.
- If an auditor is set, a request that doesn't carry its signature is considered invalid.
- Supported actions are: `Issue` and `Transfer`. `Reedem` is obtained as a `Transfer` that creates an output whose's owner is `none`.
- An `Issue Action` proves that value is in the right range and one of the authorized issuers signed the request. 
- A `Transfer Action` proves the following:
  - The sum of the inputs is equal to the sum of the outputs and the value of each output is in the valid range;
  - Inputs and outputs have the same type;
  - The owners of each input signed the request;
- The rightful owner of a token can redeem it;
- All the information required to operate the driver are found in the public parameters.
- Actions, public parameters, tokens, and tokens metadata are marshalled using `protobuf` messages.

In the coming sections, we give more details about the above key characteristics.

## Tokens and their Metadata

A token is presented on the ledger as a pair `(pedersen commitment to type and value, owner)`.
The pedersen commitment is computed as $g_0^{H_{Z_r}(Type)}g_1^{Value} g_2^{BF}$, 
where $H_{Zr}$ is the `hash to Zr` function provided by the bilinear group,
${g_i}$ are the bases of the pedersen commitment,   
$Type$ is a string, and both $Value$ and $BF$ are in $Z_r$.

The token metadata is then a tuple containing: Token type, value, blinding factor, and issuer's identity.  

The code that models the above concepts can be found under [`v1/token`](./../../token/core/zkatdlog/nogh/v1/token).
The protobuf messages for `Token` and `TokenMetadata` can be found under ['nogh/protos'](./../../token/core/zkatdlog/nogh/protos/noghactions.proto).

## Issue Action

An `issue action` is responsible for creating new tokens.  
This is a privileged operation, meaning only an `issuer` can authorize it.

The action includes the following:
- The identity of the issuer;
- The output tokens to be created;
- A zero-knowledge proof of validity of the action;
- Additional public metadata.

The code that contains the definition of the action and the prover/verifier code can be found under [`v1/issue`](./../../token/core/zkatdlog/nogh/v1/issue).
The code that assembles the issue action can be found here: [`issue.go`](./../../token/core/zkatdlog/nogh/v1/issue.go).
The protobuf messages for the action can be found under ['nogh/protos'](./../../token/core/zkatdlog/nogh/protos/noghactions.proto).

## Transfer Action

A `transfer action` spends existing tokens to create new tokens for an equivalent amount of value. 
The ownership of the new tokens can be assigned to any admissible `owner identity`.

The actions includes the following:
- The input tokens to be spent;
- The output tokens to be created;
- A zero-knowledge proof of validity of the action;
- Additional public metadata.

The code that contains the definition of the action and the prover/verifier code can be found under [`v1/transfer`](./../../token/core/zkatdlog/nogh/v1/transfer).
The code that assembles the transfer action can be found here: [`transfer.go`](./../../token/core/zkatdlog/nogh/v1/transfer.go).
The protobuf messages for the action can be found under ['nogh/protos'](./../../token/core/zkatdlog/nogh/protos/noghactions.proto).
