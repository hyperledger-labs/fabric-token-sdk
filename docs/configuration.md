# Panurus Configuration Example

The following example provides descriptions for the various keys required by Panurus.

```yaml
# ------------------- Panurus Configuration -------------------------
token:
  # version is the version of this configuration structure. 
  # If not specified, the latest version is used.
  version: v1
  # enabled determines if Panurus is enabled.
  enabled: true

  # selector configuration allows the use of different implementations of the token selector.
  # The "sherdlock" driver is the default implementation; other possible configurations are: "simple".
  # If empty, the default selector is used.
  selector:
    driver: sherdlock
    # tokens might be locked because of an ongoing transaction from the same wallet. Instead of failing immediately, the selector can retry.
    # The interval is the exact amount of seconds (for simple selector) or the max amount of seconds (sherdlock) the selector waits before retrying.
    # User-defined default: 5s
    retryInterval: 5s
    # numRetries is the number of times to retry gaining a lock on tokens before failing the transaction.
    numRetries: 3
    # leaseExpiry is the period a token can be locked, after which it is forcefully unlocked.
    # If leaseExpiry is zero, the eviction algorithm is never executed.
    leaseExpiry: 3m
    # leaseCleanupTickPeriod defines how often the eviction algorithm must be executed.
    # If leaseCleanupTickPeriod is zero, the eviction algorithm is never executed.
    leaseCleanupTickPeriod: 90s
    # Token fetcher cache configuration (sherdlock driver only)
    # The fetcher uses a Ristretto cache to store tokens for efficient retrieval.
    # fetcherCacheSize is the maximum number of tokens to cache. Each token consumes 1 unit of cache cost.
    # If not specified or set to 0, defaults to 100 million (1e8) tokens.
    fetcherCacheSize: 100000000
    # fetcherCacheRefresh is the time interval after which the cache is considered stale and will be refreshed.
    # A hard refresh (blocking) occurs when the cache becomes stale. If not specified or set to 0, defaults to 1 second.
    fetcherCacheRefresh: 1s
    # fetcherCacheMaxQueries is the number of queries after which a soft refresh (non-blocking background update) is triggered.
    # This helps keep the cache fresh without blocking queries. If not specified or set to 0, defaults to 5 queries.
    fetcherCacheMaxQueries: 5

  # When we are interested in knowing when a transaction reaches finality, we subscribe to the Finality Listener Manager for the finality event of that transaction.
  # This configuration specifies the way the manager is instantiated (i.e., how it gets notified about the finality events, how often it checks).
  finality:
    # Only applicable for fabric networks.
    # The manager subscribes to the delivery service and receives all final transactions.
    #   This manager keeps two structures: an LRU cache of recently finalized transactions, and a list of listeners that are waiting for future transactions.
    #   When a new block comes from the delivery service, we store all new transactions in the cache and notify all interested listeners.
    #   When a client subscribes to the manager for a specific transaction, we go through the following steps, which correspond to all possible scenarios with decreasing probability:
    #   a) The transaction reached finality recently, so we perform a lookup. If not found, we proceed to step b.
    #   b) The transaction will reach finality shortly, so we append a listener and wait for a timeout. If the listener reaches timeout, we proceed to step c.
    #   c) The transaction reached finality long ago, so we query the whole ledger for this specific transaction. If the query returns no result, we proceed to step d.
    #   d) The transaction will reach finality at some point beyond the timeout or never, so we return Unknown. Then it is up to the client to either append another listener or accept that the transaction will never reach finality.  
    delivery:
      # mapperParallelism is the number of goroutines that process incoming transactions in parallel. Defaults to 1.
      mapperParallelism: 10
      # blockProcessParallelism is the number of blocks we can process in parallel when they arrive from the delivery service.
      # If the value is <= 1, then blocks are processed sequentially.
      # This is the suggested configuration if we are not sure about the dependencies between blocks.
      # The total go routines processing transactions will be blockProcessParallelism * mapperParallelism.
      blockProcessParallelism: 1
      # lruSize detects how many transactions we should guarantee to keep in our recent cache.
      # If the transaction is not among these elements, we proceed to step b, as described above.
      # If lruSize and lruBuffer are not set, then we will never evict past transactions (the cache will grow infinitely).
      lruSize: 30
      # eviction will happen when the cache size exceeds lruSize + lruBuffer.
      lruBuffer: 15
      # listenerTimeout is the duration to listen when we can't find a transaction in the cache (most probably it is about to become final).
      # We will listen for this amount of time and then we will query the whole ledger, as described in step c.
      # If the timeout is not set, then the listener will never be evicted and we will never proceed to step c.
      # We will wait forever for the transaction to return (as is done for the 'committer' type).
      listenerTimeout: 10s
    # Only applicable for fabricx networks
    # notification: The manager is notified about finality events via a notification service (e.g. for FabricX).
    #   When a new notification arrives, an event is added to a queue for asynchronous processing.
    #   When a client subscribes to the manager for a specific transaction, we perform an immediate query to check its status.
    notification:
      # workers is the number of goroutines that process events in parallel. Defaults to 10.
      workers: 10
      # queueSize is the size of the event buffer. Defaults to 1000.
      queueSize: 1000
  
  # fabricx configuration for FabricX-specific settings
  fabricx:
    # lookup configuration for the lookup service
    lookup:
      # permanent lookup configuration
      permanent:
        # interval is the polling interval for permanent lookups. Defaults to 1m.
        interval: 1m
      # one-time lookup configuration
      once:
        # deadline is the maximum time to wait for a one-time lookup. Defaults to 5m.
        deadline: 5m
        # interval is the polling interval for one-time lookups. Defaults to 2s.
        interval: 2s

      namespace: tns # the name of the channel's namespace this TMS refers to, if applicable

      # sections dedicated to the definition of the storage.
      # Panurus uses multiple databases to keep track of transactions, tokens, identities, and audit records where applicable.
      # These are the available databases:
      # ttxdb: stores records of transactions.
      # tokendb: stores information about the available tokens.
      # auditdb: stores audit records about the audited transactions.
      # identitydb: stores information about wallets and identities.
      # The databases can be instantiated in isolation, a different backend for each db, or with a shared backend, depending on the driver used.
      # In the following example, we have all databases using the same backend but tokendb.

      # optional separate configuration for ttxdb, tokendb, tokenlockdb, auditdb, and identitydb
      # otherwise they default to 'default', if it is defined

### Optional: token.tms.<name>.services.network.fabric.recovery

If not specified, the default configuration is:

```yaml
token:
  tms:
    <name>:
      services:
        network:
          fabric:
            recovery:
              enabled: true
              ttl: 30s
              scanInterval: 5s
              batchSize: 100
              workerCount: 4
              leaseDuration: 30s
              advisoryLockID: 8389190333894887286
              instanceID:
              notFoundGracePeriod: 30m
```

Default values:

- enabled: true
- ttl: 30s
- scanInterval: 5s
- batchSize: 100
- workerCount: 4
- leaseDuration: 30s
- advisoryLockID: 8389190333894887286 (`0x74746b7265636f76`)
- instanceID: empty, auto-generated when the recovery manager starts
- notFoundGracePeriod: 30m (set to 0 to disable promotion to Orphan)

**Parameter Relationships and Tuning:**

- **Recovery is enabled by default** to ensure automatic recovery of lost finality listeners.
- **Only pending transactions older than `ttl` are considered for recovery** to avoid interfering with active transaction processing.
- **The manager validates** that `ttl`, `scanInterval`, `batchSize`, `workerCount`, and `leaseDuration` are all greater than zero.
- **`advisoryLockID`** is used to acquire PostgreSQL advisory-lock leadership so that only one replica performs a recovery sweep at a time. The default value (8389190333894887286 or 0x74746b7265636f76) represents the ASCII string "ttkrecov" (Token Transaction Recovery) encoded as a 64-bit integer.
- **`instanceID`** is used as the lease owner identifier for claimed transactions; if omitted, the manager generates a unique UUID automatically at startup.
- **`notFoundGracePeriod`** controls how long a transaction whose status query keeps returning `NotFound` is left in `Pending` before being promoted to the terminal `Orphan` status. This protects the recovery sweep from being permanently blocked by transactions whose audit log was persisted but whose broadcast never reached the ledger. The promoted row is marked `Orphan` rather than `Deleted` so operators can distinguish broadcast failures from ledger-rejected transactions. Raise the default if your network has long catch-up windows after committer/orderer restarts; set it to `0` to disable the promotion entirely.

**Tuning Recommendations:**

1. **For High-Throughput Environments:**
   - Increase `batchSize` to 200-500 to process more transactions per sweep
   - Increase `workerCount` to 8-16 to improve parallel processing
   - Decrease `scanInterval` to 2-3s for faster recovery detection


### Optional: token.tms.<name>.services.storage.cleanup

If not specified, the default configuration is:

```yaml
token:
  tms:
    <name>:
      services:
        storage:
          cleanup:
            enabled: false
            ttl: 24h
            scanInterval: 1h
            batchSize: 100
            workerCount: 1
            advisoryLockID: 8389190333894887277
            instanceID:
```

Default values:

- enabled: false
- ttl: 24h
- scanInterval: 1h
- batchSize: 100
- workerCount: 1
- advisoryLockID: 8389190333894887277 (`0x74746b636c65616e`)
- instanceID: empty, auto-generated when the cleanup manager starts

**Parameter Relationships and Tuning:**

- **Cleanup is disabled by default** and must be explicitly enabled. This is a conservative default to prevent unexpected key deletion in existing deployments.
- **Only deleted tokens older than `ttl` are considered for cleanup** to ensure tokens are truly finalized before key deletion.
- **The manager validates** that `ttl`, `scanInterval`, `batchSize`, and `workerCount` are all greater than zero.
- **`advisoryLockID`** is used to acquire PostgreSQL advisory-lock leadership so that only one replica performs a cleanup sweep at a time. The default value (8389190333894887277 or 0x74746b636c65616e) represents the ASCII string "ttkclean" (Token Transaction Keystore Cleanup) encoded as a 64-bit integer.
- **`instanceID`** is used to identify this replica in logs and monitoring; if omitted, the manager generates a unique identifier automatically at startup.

**Tuning Recommendations:**

1. **For High-Volume Environments:**
   - Increase `batchSize` to 200-500 to process more tokens per sweep
   - Increase `workerCount` to 8-16 to improve parallel key deletion
   - Decrease `scanInterval` to 30m for more frequent cleanup

2. **For Resource-Constrained Systems:**
   - Decrease `workerCount` to 2 to reduce CPU usage
   - Increase `scanInterval` to 2-4h to reduce database load
   - Keep default `batchSize` to limit memory usage

3. **For Security-Sensitive Deployments:**
   - Decrease `ttl` to 12h for faster key removal
   - Decrease `scanInterval` to 30m for more frequent cleanup
   - Monitor cleanup metrics to ensure timely processing

4. **For Multi-Instance Deployments:**
   - **PostgreSQL Required**: Multi-instance deployments require PostgreSQL for distributed coordination via advisory locks
   - Keep default `advisoryLockID` unless running multiple independent cleanup systems
   - Consider setting explicit `instanceID` values for easier debugging and monitoring

5. **For Single-Node Deployments:**
   - **SQLite Supported**: SQLite can be used for single-node deployments and handles node restarts gracefully
   - Cleanup works automatically after node restarts by scanning for eligible tokens
   - **Important**: Do not use SQLite with multiple replicas as it lacks the advisory lock mechanism for leader election

**Performance Considerations:**
- Each scan queries the token database, so `scanInterval` directly affects database load
- `workerCount` affects CPU utilization during cleanup sweeps
- `batchSize` affects memory usage and the duration of each cleanup sweep
- The relationship `scanInterval < ttl` ensures timely cleanup without premature processing

### Optional: token.tms.<name>.auditor.lock

If not specified, the default configuration is:

```yaml
token:
  tms:
    <name>:
      auditor:
        lock:
          maxRetries: 10
          initialBackoff: 10ms
          maxBackoff: 5s
          backoffMultiplier: 2.0
          jitterFactor: 0.3
```

Default values:

- maxRetries: 10
- initialBackoff: 10ms
- maxBackoff: 5s
- backoffMultiplier: 2.0
- jitterFactor: 0.3

**Parameter Descriptions:**

- **maxRetries**: Maximum number of retry attempts when acquiring locks on enrollment IDs during audit operations
- **initialBackoff**: Initial delay before the first retry attempt
- **maxBackoff**: Maximum delay between retry attempts (exponential backoff is capped at this value)
- **backoffMultiplier**: Factor by which the backoff delay increases after each retry (exponential growth)
- **jitterFactor**: Randomization factor (0.0 to 1.0) added to backoff delays to prevent multiple auditors from retrying simultaneously (prevents thundering herd problem)

**Tuning Recommendations:**

1. **For High-Contention Environments:**
   - Increase `maxRetries` to 15-20 to handle more lock conflicts
   - Increase `maxBackoff` to 10s to spread out retry attempts
   - Keep `jitterFactor` at 0.3 or higher to maintain randomization

2. **For Low-Latency Requirements:**
   - Decrease `initialBackoff` to 5ms for faster initial retries
   - Decrease `maxBackoff` to 2s to avoid long waits
   - Increase `backoffMultiplier` to 3.0 for faster exponential growth

3. **For Resource-Constrained Environments:**
   - Decrease `maxRetries` to 5 to fail faster
   - Keep default backoff settings to balance retry attempts with resource usage

2. **For Resource-Constrained Environments:**
   - Decrease `batchSize` to 50 to reduce memory usage
   - Decrease `workerCount` to 2 to reduce CPU load
   - Increase `scanInterval` to 10-15s to reduce database queries

3. **For Long-Running Transaction Assembly:**
   - Increase `ttl` to 60s or more to avoid premature recovery attempts
   - Ensure `leaseDuration` is at least 2x the expected transaction processing time

4. **For Multi-Instance Deployments:**
   - **PostgreSQL Required**: Multi-instance deployments require PostgreSQL for distributed coordination via advisory locks
   - Keep default `advisoryLockID` unless running multiple independent recovery systems
   - Consider setting explicit `instanceID` values for easier debugging and monitoring
   - Ensure all instances share the same PostgreSQL database for proper coordination

5. **For Single-Node Deployments:**
   - **SQLite Supported**: SQLite can be used for single-node deployments and handles node restarts gracefully
   - Recovery works automatically after node restarts by scanning for pending transactions
   - **Important**: Do not use SQLite with multiple replicas as it lacks the advisory lock mechanism for leader election

**Performance Impact:**
- Each scan queries the transaction database, so `scanInterval` directly affects database load
- `workerCount` affects CPU and network utilization during recovery sweeps
- `batchSize` affects memory usage and the duration of each recovery sweep
- The relationship `scanInterval < ttl` ensures timely detection without premature recovery

### Optional: token.tms.<name>.auditor.locker

Controls the distributed locking strategy used by the auditor to serialise
concurrent access to enrollment IDs (EIDs) when processing audit records.

If not specified, the default configuration is:

```yaml
token:
  tms:
    <name>:
      auditor:
        locker:
          backend: memory
          postgres:
            ttl: 30s
            acquireBackoff: 100ms
            acquireDeadline: 1m
            heartbeat: 10s
            owner:
```

Default values:

- backend: `memory` (in-process mutex, single-replica only)
- postgres.ttl: 30s
- postgres.acquireBackoff: 100ms
- postgres.acquireDeadline: 1m
- postgres.heartbeat: 10s
- postgres.owner: empty, defaults to the FSC node ID (`config.Provider.ID()`)

**Backend Selection:**

| Backend    | Use case                      | Database requirement |
|------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|
| `memory`   | Single-replica deployments    | Any (SQLite, Postgres) |
| `postgres` | Multi-replica deployments     | PostgreSQL only        |

**Notes:**
- The `postgres` backend uses a dedicated lease table (created automatically) with row-level locking, heartbeat renewal, and automatic expiry. It relies on PostgreSQL-specific SQL features (`ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE … RETURNING`, `::interval` casts, `TIMESTAMPTZ`).
- The `memory` backend uses in-process semaphores and provides no cross-replica coordination. It is suitable for single-node or development setups.
- When using `postgres`, all auditor replicas must share the same PostgreSQL database so that EID locks are globally visible.
- Set `heartbeat` to roughly `ttl / 3` to ensure leases are renewed well before expiry.
