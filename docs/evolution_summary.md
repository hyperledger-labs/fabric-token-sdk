# Evolution of Fabric Token SDK (v0.4.0 -> Present)

Since tag `v0.4.0` (January 2025), the Fabric Token SDK has undergone a significant architectural and functional evolution, comprising over 850 commits. The evolution can be summarized in several key areas:

## Architectural Refinement: Common Driver Framework
The SDK has transitioned toward a more modular and robust internal driver architecture. A major shift involved moving core driver interfaces and shared logic into the `token/core/common/driver` package. This decoupling allows for more uniform driver implementations and simplifies the introduction of new token technologies.

## Privacy-Preserving Driver Evolution: `zkatdlog/nogh`
One of the most substantial additions is the `nogh` (**No Graph Hiding**) variant of the `zkatdlog` driver. This variant represents an optimization and refinement of the zero-knowledge token logic, providing a more efficient way to handle private transactions by omitting graph-hiding properties. 
*   *See also:* [**DLog w/o Graph Hiding (NOGH) Driver**](drivers/dlogwogh.md)

- **Upgradability Support:** The `nogh` driver explicitly supports token upgradability. 
    - **In-place Upgrades:** Compatible legacy tokens (like Fabtoken) can be spent directly by the `nogh` driver. The driver automatically generates Pedersen commitments and an "Upgrade Witness" on the fly, allowing for transparent migration during standard transfer operations. Criteria for compatibility include format inclusion in the driver's supported list and precision alignment (e.g., legacy precision $\le$ current max precision).
    - **Burn and Re-issue:** For major migrations, it implements a "Burn and Re-issue" mechanism. This is facilitated by a dedicated `upgrade` service that handles challenge-response protocols and proof verification to ensure supply consistency during migration.
    *   *See also:* [**Upgradability Guide**](upgradability.md)
- **Data Model & Protocol Buffers:** The `nogh` driver introduces a refined data model for tokens and metadata. Tokens are represented as Pedersen commitments to the token type, value, and blinding factor. Newly defined protocol buffers support this optimized model.
    *   *See also:* [**DLog Protobuf Messages**](drivers/dlogwogh.md#protobuf-messages)
- **Driver Versioning:** The implementation follows a clear versioning strategy, with the current `nogh` driver logic residing in the `v1` sub-package (`token/core/zkatdlog/nogh/v1`). This versioning ensures that future protocol changes can be introduced without breaking backward compatibility for existing ledger data.
- **Crypto & Math:** New `bls12_381_bbs` curve support and improved cryptographic primitives are integrated into the `v1` implementation.
- **Auditing:** A dedicated auditing layer (`v1/audit`) provides necessary compliance tools for private token systems.

## Enhanced Security: Protocol V2
A major security enhancement introduced **Protocol V2** for token request signatures, addressing critical vulnerabilities in the original implementation:

- **Structured Signature Format:** Protocol V2 uses ASN.1-structured messages with explicit field boundaries, eliminating boundary ambiguity attacks present in Protocol V1's simple concatenation approach.
- **Input Validation:** Comprehensive validation with typed errors prevents DoS attacks through anchor size limits (128 bytes max) and ensures non-empty anchors.
- **Secure Error Handling:** Binary data is hex-encoded in error messages, preventing sensitive data exposure in logs and log aggregation systems.
- **Collision Resistance:** The structured format ensures different (Request, Anchor) pairs always produce different signature messages, providing tamper-evident properties.
- **Backward Compatibility:** Protocol V1 remains supported for existing deployments while Protocol V2 is recommended for all new implementations.

## Cryptographic Optimization: Compressed Sigma Protocol Range Proofs
The SDK now implements **Compressed Sigma Protocol-Based Range Proofs**, providing significant performance improvements for zero-knowledge range validation:

- **Reduced Proof Size:** Compressed proofs are substantially smaller than traditional Bulletproofs, reducing on-chain storage and network bandwidth requirements.
- **Faster Verification:** Optimized verification algorithms improve transaction validation throughput.
- **Configurable Executor Patterns:** Introduction of `ExecutorProvider`, `WorkerPoolExecutor`, and `UnboundedExecutor` allows fine-tuned control over proof generation and verification parallelism.
- **Constructor Injection:** Executor patterns are threaded through cryptographic components (`RangeCorrectnessProver`, `RangeCorrectnessVerifier`) enabling flexible performance tuning.

## Token Transaction (TTX) Service Modernization
The Token Transaction service, a core component for orchestrating token lifecycles, has been significantly refactored:

- **Dependency Injection Pattern:** The introduction of the `dep/` sub-package in the TTX service enables better dependency management, reducing circular dependencies and drastically improving unit testability.
- **Multisig Support:** New capabilities for multi-signature transactions have been introduced in `token/services/ttx/multisig`.
- **Finality Tracking:** Improved transaction finality handling via the new `token/services/ttx/finality` package, including a new `TTXRecoveryHandler` for synchronous transaction recovery.
- **Transaction Recovery:** A new recovery mechanism has been introduced to automatically re-register finality listeners for pending transactions that may have lost their listeners due to node restarts or network issues. The recovery service includes:
    - **Automatic Re-registration:** Scans for pending transactions and re-establishes finality listeners on startup
    - **Configurable Retry Logic:** Supports exponential backoff with configurable retry limits
    - **Backend-Agnostic:** Works with both PostgreSQL and SQLite storage backends
    - **Network Integration:** Instantiated by both Fabric and FabricX network services
    - **Dual Database Support:** Operates on TTXDB for regular transactions and AuditDB for auditor nodes
