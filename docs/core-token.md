# Example core.yaml section

The following example provides descriptions for the various keys required for a Fabric Smart Client node that uses the Token SDK.

```yaml
# ------------------- Token SDK Configuration -------------------------
token:
  # Is the token-sdk enabled
  enabled: true

  # token selector configuration allows to use different implementations of the token selector
  # the "default" driver is the mailman implementation, other possible configurations are: "simple"
  selector:
    driver: mailman

  tms:
    mytms: # unique name of this token management system
      network: default # the name of the network this TMS refers to (Fabric, Orion, etc)
      channel: testchannel # the name of the network's channel this TMS refers to, if applicable
      namespace: tns # the name of the channel's namespace this TMS refers to, if applicable

      # sections dedicated to the definition of the storage.
      # The Token-SDK uses multiple databases to keep track of transactions, tokens, identities, and audit records where it applies.  
      # These are the available databases:
      # ttxdb: store records of transactions 
      # tokendb: store information about the available tokens
      # auditdb: store audit records about the audited transactions
      # identitydb: store information about wallets and identities
      # The databases can be instantiated in isolation, a different backend for each db, or with a shared backend, depending on the driver used.
      # In the following example, we have all databases using the same backed but tokendb.

      # shared db configuration. The `unity` driver is used as provider.  
      db:
        persistence:
          # configuration for the unity db driver. It uses sql as backend

    # The sql driver uses golangs database/sql package internally.

    # for instance `import _ "github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3"` for the cgo version of sqlite.
    # See https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SQLDrivers. We only tested with github.com/lib/pq
    # and modernc.org/sqlite, and it's likely that other drivers don't work exactly the same.
    # To try a new sql driver, add a test here: token/services/ttxdb/db/sql/sql_test.go.
    # 
    # type: sql
    # opts:

    #   dataSource: /some/path/ttxdb.sqlite
    #   maxOpenConns: 10  # by default this is 0 (unlimited), sets the maximum number of open connections to the database
    #
    # Alternative (`import _ "github.com/lib/pq"`).
    # The 'dataSource' field can be sensitive (contain a password). In that case,
    # set it in the TTXDB_DATASOURCE environment variable instead of in this file.
