# Samples

Samples are a collection of small and simple apps that demonstrate how to use the library.

To run the samples, we recommend to use go 1.16 or later. You will also need docker when using Fabric.
To make sure you have all the required docker images, you can run `make docker-images` in the
folder `$GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperledger-labs/fabric-token-sdk`.

- [`Fungible Tokens, The Basics. On Fabric`](./fabric/fungible//README.md): A showcase of some capabilities that the Token SDK offers.
