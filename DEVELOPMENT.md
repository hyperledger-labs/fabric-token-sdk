# Development Guidelines

This document outlines the contribution and development practices to ensure a clean and maintainable Git history.

## 1. Commit Sign-Off Requirement

All commits must be **signed off** to certify that the contributor agrees to the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/). 
This is a legal statement indicating that you wrote the code or have the right to contribute it.

### How to Sign Off a Commit

When creating a commit, use the `-s` flag:

```bash
git commit -s -m "feat: add token validation logic"
```

This will append a `Signed-off-by` line with your name and email address, matching the information in your Git configuration.

Example:

```
Signed-off-by: Jane Doe <jane.doe@example.com>
```

If you forgot to sign off a commit, you can amend the last commit:

```bash
git commit --amend -s
```

Or for multiple commits, you can rebase and add the sign-offs:

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~N  # replace N with number of commits to edit
# Then mark each commit with 'edit' and sign off each one:
git commit --amend -s
git rebase --continue
```

## 2. Linear Commit History: Rebase, Donâ€™t Merge

We follow a **linear commit history** to keep the Git log clean and easy to follow. This means **no merge commits** should be introduced.

### Rebase Workflow

1. Before pushing your branch, always rebase on the latest `main`:

   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/main
   ```

2. If there are any conflicts, resolve them and continue the rebase:

   ```bash
   git status           # See conflicted files
   # Edit and resolve conflicts
   git add <resolved-files>
   git rebase --continue
   ```

3. Force push your rebased branch to update your pull request:

   ```bash
   git push --force-with-lease
   ```

### Why No Merge Commits?

- They clutter the history.
- They make it harder to identify what changes were made.
- They complicate tools that generate changelogs or audit logs.

## 3. Additional Notes

- Use clear, concise commit messages (preferably using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)).
- Squash commits as needed before submission to keep the history clean.
- Open a pull request only after your branch is up-to-date and rebased on `main`.
