## Good first issues

We maintain a set of issues labeled "good first issue" to help new contributors find approachable tasks and get started quickly. 
If you're contributing for the first time, please consider picking one of these issues:

- Browse the current list here: https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fabric-token-sdk/issues?q=is%3Aissue+state%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22
- Leave a comment on the issue saying you'd like to work on it and ask to be assigned.
- If you need clarification or guidance, ask on our Discord channel (`#fabric-token-sdk`) or comment on the issue — maintainers and community members are happy to help.
- Keep your first PR small and focused. Follow the project guidelines: run tests, sign your commits (`-s`), and rebase to keep a linear history.

## Detailed Development Guidelines

Please refer to the [Development Guidelines](docs/development/development.md) for detailed information on:

*   **Commit Sign-off**: All commits must be signed off (`git commit -s`).
*   **Linear History**: We use rebase workflow, not merge commits.
