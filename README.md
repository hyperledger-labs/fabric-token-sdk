# Motivation

**Hyperledger Fabric: Blockchain Built for Business**

Hyperledger Fabric ([https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/)) is an open-source platform designed for permissioned blockchain networks. It offers a modular and extensible architecture, allowing for customization and future growth.  Unlike traditional blockchains, Fabric applications can be written in any general-purpose programming language, making them more accessible to developers.

**Beyond Cryptocurrencies: Tokenizing the World**

While blockchain is often associated with cryptocurrencies, its potential extends far beyond. Fabric allows for the creation of tokens that represent real-world assets, both fungible (like loyalty points) and non-fungible (like unique digital artwork). This opens doors for new business models and unlocks additional value from existing assets.

**The Challenge: Building Tokenized Applications**

Developing applications that leverage tokens on Hyperledger Fabric can be complex. Fabric lacked a built-in SDK for creating and managing tokens, forcing developers to build solutions from scratch.  This not only led to wasted effort with duplicated code, but also exposed applications to potential security vulnerabilities.

**Introducing Panurus: Streamlining Tokenized Development (and Beyond)**

Panurus has evolved beyond its initial focus on Hyperledger Fabric. It now empowers developers with the following capabilities across various platforms, including permissioned blockchains like Fabric:

* **Tokenization Made Easy:** Create tokens representing any type of asset, be it physical or digital.
* **Privacy by Design:** Select the appropriate privacy level for your specific use case, without modifying your application logic.
* **Peer-to-Peer Transactions:** Orchestrate token transfers directly between users, streamlining the process.
* **Atomic Swaps:** Facilitate secure exchanges of different tokens without relying on intermediaries.
* **Transaction Auditing:** Review transactions before they are finalized, ensuring accuracy and compliance.
* **Interoperability:** Connect with token systems on other blockchain networks, fostering broader ecosystems.
* **Seamless Integration:** Add a token layer to existing applications, regardless of platform, with minimal effort.

With Panurus, developing secure and efficient enterprise-grade tokenized applications becomes a reality, offering flexibility for developers to choose the platform that best suits their needs.
