The `Fabric Token SDK` provides a collection of APIs and services that streamline development for token-based distributed applications.

# Disclaimer

`Fabric Token SDK` has not been audited and is provided as-is, use at your own risk.
The project will be subject to rapid changes to complete the open-sourcing process, and  the list of features.

# Getting started

Clone the code and make sure it is on your `$GOPATH`.
(Important: we assume in this documentation and default configuration that your `$GOPATH` has a single root-directory!).
Sometimes, we use `$FTS_PATH` to refer to the Fabric Token SDK repository in your filesystem.

```bash
export FTS_PATH=$GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperledger-labs/fabric-token-sdk
git clone https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fabric-token-sdk.git $FTS_PATH
```

## Further information

Fabric Token SDK uses a system called `NWO` from Fabric Smart Client for its integration tests and samples to programmatically create a fabric network along with the fabric-smart-client nodes. The current version of fabric that is tested can be found in the project [Makefile](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fabric-smart-client/blob/main/Makefile) set in the `FABRIC_VERSION` variable.

In order for a fabric network to be able to be created you need to ensure you have downloaded the appropriate version of the hyperledger fabric binaries from [Fabric Releases](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/releases) and unpack the compressed file onto your file system. This will create a directory structure of /bin and /config. You will then need to set the environment variable `FAB_BINS` to the `bin` directory. For example if you unpacked the compressed file into `/home/name/fabric` then you would

```bash
export FAB_BINS=/home/name/fabric/bin
```

Do not store the fabric binaries within your fabric-token-sdk cloned repo as this will cause problems running the samples and integration tests as they will not be able to install chaincode.

Almost all the samples and integration tests require the fabric binaries to be downloaded and the environment variable `FAB_BINS` set to point to the directory where these binaries are stored. One way to ensure this is to execute the following in the root of the fabric-token-sdk project

```shell
make download-fabric
export FAB_BINS=$PWD/../fabric/bin
```

You can also use this to download a different version of the fabric binaries for example

```shell
FABRIC_VERSION=2.5 make download-fabric
```

If you want to provide your own versions of the fabric binaries then just set `FAB_BINS` to the directory where all the fabric binaries are stored.
  
# Utilities

- [`tokengen`](./cmd/tokengen/README.md) is an utility for generating Fabric Token-SDK material.
  It is provided as a means of preconfiguring public parameters, token chaincode, and so.
  It would normally not be used in the operation of a production network.

# Motivation

**Hyperledger Fabric: Blockchain Built for Business**

Hyperledger Fabric ([https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/)) is an open-source platform designed for permissioned blockchain networks. It offers a modular and extensible architecture, allowing for customization and future growth.  Unlike traditional blockchains, Fabric applications can be written in any general-purpose programming language, making them more accessible to developers.

**Beyond Cryptocurrencies: Tokenizing the World**

While blockchain is often associated with cryptocurrencies, its potential extends far beyond. Fabric allows for the creation of tokens that represent real-world assets, both fungible (like loyalty points) and non-fungible (like unique digital artwork). This opens doors for new business models and unlocks additional value from existing assets.

**The Challenge: Building Tokenized Applications**

Developing applications that leverage tokens on Hyperledger Fabric can be complex. Fabric lacked a built-in SDK for creating and managing tokens, forcing developers to build solutions from scratch.  This not only led to wasted effort with duplicated code, but also exposed applications to potential security vulnerabilities.

**Introducing the Fabric Token SDK: Streamlining Tokenized Development (and Beyond)**

The Fabric Token SDK has evolved beyond its initial focus on Hyperledger Fabric. It now empowers developers with the following capabilities across various platforms, including permissioned blockchains like Fabric and even centralized systems like Orion:

* **Tokenization Made Easy:** Create tokens representing any type of asset, be it physical or digital.
* **Privacy by Design:** Select the appropriate privacy level for your specific use case, without modifying your application logic.
* **Peer-to-Peer Transactions:** Orchestrate token transfers directly between users, streamlining the process.
* **Atomic Swaps:** Facilitate secure exchanges of different tokens without relying on intermediaries.
* **Transaction Auditing:** Review transactions before they are finalized, ensuring accuracy and compliance.
* **Interoperability:** Connect with token systems on other blockchain networks, fostering broader ecosystems.
* **Seamless Integration:** Add a token layer to existing applications, regardless of platform, with minimal effort.

With a robust Fabric Token SDK, developing secure and efficient enterprise-grade tokenized applications becomes a reality, offering flexibility for developers to choose the platform that best suits their needs.

# Testing Philosophy

[Write tests. Not too many. Mostly Integration](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/write-tests)

We also believe that when developing new functions running tests is preferable than running the application to verify the code is working as expected.

For more information about our integration tests, look [`here`](./docs/itests.md).
