The `Fabric Token SDK` is a set of API and services that let developers create 
token-based distributed application on Hyperledger Fabric.

# Motivation

[Hyperledger Fabric]('https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric') is a permissioned, modular, and extensible open-source DLT platform. Fabric architecture follows a novel `execute-order-validate` paradigm that supports distributed execution of untrusted code in an untrusted environment. Indeed, Fabric-based distributed applications can be written in any general-purpose programming language.  
Fabric does not depend on a native cryptocurrency as it happens for existing blockchain platforms that require “smart-contracts” to be written in domain-specific languages or rely on a cryptocurrency.

Blockchain technologies are accelerating the shifting towards a decentralised economy. Cryptocurrencies are reshaping the financial landscape to the extent that even central banks are now testing the technology to propose what is known as the `central bank digital currency`. But it is more than this. Real-world assets are being tokenised as fungible or non-fungible assets represented by tokens on a blockchain. Thus enabling business opportunities to extract more value.

Developing token-based applications for Hyperledger Fabric is not easy. Fabric does not provide an out-of-the-box SDK that let developers create tokens that represents any kind of asset. Developers are left on their own and this exposes them to useless duplication of code and security vulnerabilities.

What would happen if the developers could use a `Fabric Token SDK` that let:
- Create tokens that represents any kind of asset (baked by a real-world asset or virtual);
- Choose the privacy level that best fits the use-case without changing the application logic;
- Orchestrate token transaction in a peer-to-peer fashion;
- Perform atomic swaps;
- Audit transactions before they get committed;
- Interoperate with token systems in other blockchain networks;
- Add a token layer to existing Fabric distributed application?

Developing Enterprise Token-based distributed applications would become simpler and more secure.

# Testing Philosophy

[Write tests. Not too many. Mostly Integration](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/write-tests)

We also believe that when developing new functions running tests is preferable than running the application to verify the code is working as expected.

We use [`SemVer`](https://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [`tags on this repository`](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fabric-token-sdk/tags).
